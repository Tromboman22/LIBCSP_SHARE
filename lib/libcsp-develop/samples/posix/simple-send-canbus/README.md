# Simple Send via CANbus

This is a simple sample code to send `"abc"` to a server via the
CANbus interface.

## How to Build

```
$ cmake -B builddir
$ ninja -C builddir simple-send-canbus csp_server
```

## How to Test

To run without a real CANbus hardware, you can setup a vcan interface
on Linux:

```
$ sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
$ sudo ip link set up vcan0
```

This command will create a virtual CANbus interface that a server and
a client can share.

Youâ€™ll need the `ip` command. If you don't have it, install it with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install iproute2
```

First, you need to run a CSP server:

```
$ ./builddir/examples/csp_server -c vcan0 -a 1
Initialising CSP
INIT CAN: device: [vcan0], bitrate: 1000000, promisc: 1

Server task started
```

Then, in another terminal, run `simple-send-canbus`

```
$ ./builddir/samples/posix/simple-send-canbus/simple-send-canbus
INIT CAN: device: [vcan0], bitrate: 1000000, promisc: 1

```

You see warnings like `RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted`
because your are not root. It should work without using `sudo`.  Also
even you use `sudo`, you still see a few warnings because `vcan0` does
not support a few operations.

If you successfully run `simple-send-canbus`, you see the following
message on the server terminal.

```
Packet received on SERVER_PORT: abc
```
